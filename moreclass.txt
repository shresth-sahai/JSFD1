Singleton class -> ensures only one object of the class can ever be created in entire app
Databases -> only 1 obj 

class Singleton {

    private static SingleTon instance=null;

    private SingleTon() {}


    public static SingleTon getInstance(){
        if(instance==null) instance=new SingleTon();
        return instance;
    }
}
SingleTon obj=new SingleTon.getInstance();


POJO class->plain old java object 
simple data carrying class witb private fields
public getters & setters 
no buisness logic 
why -> to store datta and transfer data between layers
class Student{
    int id; string name; 

    public Student(){}
    public Student(int id,String name){this.id=id;this.name=name;}

    // getter & seeters 
    public int getId(){ return id;}
    public void setId(int id){this.id=id;}

}

Generic Class -> 
it allows us to create class es that work with any data tyep 
class intbox class stringbox
class Box <T> { } -> tyep safety and code

class Box<T>{

private T value;

public void setValue(T value){
    this.value=value;
}
public T getValue(){
    return value;
}
}
Box <Integer> intbox=new Box<>();
intbox.setValue(10);



6. A Singleton class ensures:

a) Only one instance of the class exists at a time
b) The class cannot be inherited
c) The class cannot have constructors
d) The class must be abstract

7. A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class typically contains:

a) Business logic and database operations
b) Getters, setters, constructors, and private fields
c) Only static methods
d) Only abstract methods

8. Which of the following is TRUE about utility classes?

a) They are always abstract
b) They contain only static methods and variables
c) They cannot be final
d) They always have public constructors

9. Which type of class must provide implementation for all inherited abstract methods?

a) Abstract class
b) Concrete class
c) Anonymous class
d) Final class

10. Which type of class is typically used for short usage like event listeners or comparators?

a) POJO class
b) Final class
c) Anonymous inner class
d) Static nested class



Question : 


A POJO Class — Student

Create a POJO class with:

private fields: rollNo, name, marks

getters & setters

parameterized constructor

toString() method

A Utility Class — StudentUtil

Create a Utility class with:

a static method calculatePercentage(Student s)

a static method isPassed(Student s) (pass if marks ≥ 40)

a private constructor to prevent object creation

A Generic Class — Box<T>

Create a generic class that can store ANY type:

private field value

setter method

getter method

A Singleton Class — DatabaseConnection

Create a Singleton class:

private static instance

private constructor

public static getInstance()

a method connect() that prints "Connected to database"

Write the Main class to do the following:

In the main method:

Create a Student object

Use Utility class to calculate percentage and pass/fail

Use a Generic Box to store the Student object

Access the Singleton and call connect()

Print all outputs

EXPECTED OUTPUT (example)
Student: RollNo=101, Name=Amit, Marks=85
Percentage: 85.0
Result: Passed
Box contains: Student object
Connected to database
