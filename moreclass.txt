Singleton class -> ensures only one object of the class can ever be created in entire app
Databases -> only 1 obj 

class Singleton {

    private static SingleTon instance=null;

    private SingleTon() {}


    public static SingleTon getInstance(){
        if(instance==null) instance=new SingleTon();
        return instance;
    }
}
SingleTon obj=new SingleTon.getInstance();


POJO class->plain old java object 
simple data carrying class witb private fields
public getters & setters 
no buisness logic 
why -> to store datta and transfer data between layers
class Student{
    int id; string name; 

    public Student(){}
    public Student(int id,String name){this.id=id;this.name=name;}

    // getter & seeters 
    public int getId(){ return id;}
    public void setId(int id){this.id=id;}

}

Generic Class -> 
it allows us to create class es that work with any data tyep 
class intbox class stringbox
class Box <T> { } -> tyep safety and code

class Box<T>{

private T value;

public void setValue(T value){
    this.value=value;
}
public T getValue(){
    return value;
}
}
Box <Integer> intbox=new Box<>();
intbox.setValue(10);
