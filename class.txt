concrete class -> 
we can create a instance of them using new 
class Person{
    int empId;
    Person(int empId){

    }
}
// interface -> 
public interface Shape{
    public void area();
}
class Rectange implements Shape{

    @Oevrride
    public area(){

    }
}

abstarct class 
hide intenal implementation 
public abstarct class Car{
    int mileage;

coding question :

Coding Question:

Create an abstract class Shape with:

One abstract method:

double area();


One non-abstract method:

void displayType()


Create two concrete classes:

Circle → constructor takes radius

Rectangle → constructor takes length, width

Each class should:

Implement the area() method

Print the correct area using System.out.println()

Task:

In main():

Create one Circle object and one Rectangle object

Call displayType() and area() on both
