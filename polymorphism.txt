// OOPS principal 

interface can be used as Data Type 
we cannot create an object but it holds reference of class which implmenets 
public class Main{

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Bird bobj1=new Bird();


        bobj1.fly();
    }
}


abstract class           VS         interfaces 
constructor                         no 
it can provide
impl of interface.                      no 
static, non staitc etc.              Constants
